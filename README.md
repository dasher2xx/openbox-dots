# openbox-dots
Welcome to my openbox dots, here are my .config files as well as .themes, .fonts, and .icons folders

# dependencies

(to achieve the setup I have)

- dunst (notification manager)
- tint2 (bar)
- alacritty (terminal emulator)
- openbox (the window manager, with openbox I recommend installing obmenu and obconf)
- nitrogen (wallpaper setter)
- nemo (file manager)
- lxappearance (to set the GTK theme)
- rofi (application launcher)
- pamixer (to control pulseaudio, it's not that important but a must if you want my default keybindings to work)

# installation 

- copy all .files to your home directory and apply the font, gtk theme, openbox theme in the lxappearance and obconf app.
